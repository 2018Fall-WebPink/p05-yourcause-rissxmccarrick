            <h2>What is the issue?</h2>
             
            <p>The modeling industry is notoriously known to be "cutthroat". The industry has a history of body shaming and causing eating disorters. All of which are true, there are a lot of other isseues that have come about. The lack of diversity in the modeling world and rejection of the transgender community are other problems that need to be fixed in the modeling industry. Sexual assult and harassment are also other problems that are commmon the in the modeling industry.

            <h2>Today's Modeling Industry</h2> 
            <p2>Over the past years there has been some positive changes in the modeling industry. The curvy model, Ashley Graham, has become a role model in the modeling world. She spreads positivity about being confident in yourself and being comfterable in your body. There is another model named Winnie Harlow who has a skin condition called vitiligo. Vitiligo is a loss of pigmentation in the skin. She has thrived in the modeling industry and just walked for The Victoria Secret Fashion Show for the first time. </p2>

                 title="Ashley" />
            <img id="Graham" src="Graham%20Mag.jpg"

                 title="Graham" />
            <img id="Harlow" src="Winnie%20Harlow2.jpg"
                 alt="image5"
                 title="Harlow" />
            <img id="Winnie" src="Winnie%20Harlow.jpg"
                 alt="Image3"
                 title="Winnie" />
            
            <!-- This talks about what needs to be changed. -->
            <h2 id="nofloat">What Need's to Be Changed?</h2>
            <img id="Marissa" src="Girls%20Life.jpg"
                alt="Riss"
                title="girl" />
            
             <p3> Although the acceptance of diversity in the modeling industry has improved, it is not enough. There are many who are rejected because of their size, race, and sexuality. Due to the harsh critcism in the modeling industry it has developed a bad reputation. I believe that the way models are being treated should change. People in the industurey should not be so judgemental towards models. There is no reason to reject a model just because of their sexuality and gender. This topic speaks to me because I am in the modeling industry and I see it a lot. This bothers me because no one deserves to be treated that way. I am very passionat about modeling and always will be. I have been modeling since I was eight years old. I will continue to stand up for what I believe in because it is important to me.</p3>  
                <p4> I aspire to become a <a href="https://www.victoriassecret.com/">Victoria Secret Model</a> in the future. I also hope to be on the cover of American Vogue! My plans for the future are to attend a four year college in New York City and get signed to a <b>big modeling agency</b>. </p4>
